# Sample Java Code

A small repository for some sample Java code.  Currently, it has two sources:

* Some sample [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) solutions I used to refresh my memory on Java syntax, and
* Some sample code from my AP Computer Science A class (CSC500) at [Phillips Academy](http://www.andover.edu/).
